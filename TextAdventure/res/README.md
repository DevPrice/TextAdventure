RantVocab
=========

These are the official dictionaries for the Rant language.

**Contributions are welcome.** I love new words! If you want to add something, be it big or small, send a pull request and I'll get to it within a couple days at the most.

To learn the Rant dictionary file format, see [this article](http://github.com/TheBerkin/Rant/wiki/Dictionary-format).

**Note:** These dictionaries contain potentially objectionable content. Such entries should *always* be placed under a `#nsfw` context. Rant will exclude these entries by default when loading vocabulary, but if you want to include them, specify `NsfwFilter.Allow` in your `RantEngine` constructor.

*These files are made available publicly without license or restriction. Use them in any way you wish.*
